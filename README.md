# Estrella Music v2
**The Modern Flutter Evolution of Music Streaming**

</div>

---

## 🌟 What is Estrella Music v2?

**Estrella Music v2** is a high-performance, cross-platform music streaming application built using Flutter. This version represents a powerful fusion between the robust engine of [Harmony Music](https://github.com/anandnet/Harmony-Music) and the feature-rich legacy of the original [Estrella Music Kotlin project](https://github.com/josprox/Joss-Music).

By combining the best of both worlds, we've created an experience that is faster, more beautiful, and tightly integrated with the YouTube Music ecosystem, while maintaining full compatibility with your existing music library.
